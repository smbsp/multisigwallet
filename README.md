# Multisig Wallet - Blockchain - React & Solidity

Multisig stands for multi-signature, which is a specific type of digital signature that makes it possible for two or more users to sign documents as a group. Therefore, a multi-signature is produced through the combination of multiple unique signatures. The Front End is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How does Multisig wallet work?

Let’s say that Alice, Bob, and Charlie all want to open a business together and invest some of their money. For obvious reasons, none of them actually want only one person to have the private keys to this money.So, they each get one key and use a multisig wallet that requires two out of three of those keys. This way none of them can run away with the money alone, yet they don’t need all three of them to pay an expense.
